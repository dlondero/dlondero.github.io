I started blogging in 2005 (August 9th is the date of my first post using WordPress)
and I've done it on two different blogs: one for my private life and another
related to PHP. Both in italian.

Since at least one year now, I started thinking it would be good to start blogging
in english as well about technical stuff so I opened this new space without mixing
languages in the old blogs.

Also it allows me to play with Jekyll that was on my todo list for a while.

Cya!
